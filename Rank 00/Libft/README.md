During our introduction to C programming in the 42 school entrance test, we were introduced to a series of basic functions.

This library will accompany us as students throughout the 42cursus.

It is essential and my main objective with this project to understand the functions and learn to use them.

## Usage
A makefile has been provided to compile the functions and the make bonus command must be used for additional list functions.
